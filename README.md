# matpower-pip

Make [MATPOWER](https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower) installable from [`pypi`](https://pypi.org/project/matpower/). This package make `MATPOWER` copy (currently Version `7.1`) as `python package`. Use this package with [`mypower`](https://github.com/yasirroni/mypower) (the recommended way) or [`oct2py`](https://github.com/blink1073/oct2py) to run `MATPOWER` using octave client. `matlab.engine` is also supported. For the latest docs, read [README on GitHub](https://github.com/yasirroni/matpower-pip#readme).

This project also listed on [related links](https://matpower.org/related-links/) on matpower official website. Please visit that site to find other useful resources.

## Installation

### `matpower`

For downloading `MATPOWER` only (maybe you will run it using `matlab.engine` or any other method, or simply want an easy `MATPOWER` downloader):

```plaintext
pip install matpower
```

### `oct2py` (Windows)

For callable `matpower` via `oct2py` (require octave on environment system `PATH`):

1. Download [octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html).

2. Install octave, write down the destination path.

3. Open Environment Variable. You can access it by pressing <kbd>Windows-Key</kbd>, type `edit the system environment variables`, and press <kbd>&#9166;Enter</kbd> to search.

4. Add new Environment Variable to execute `octave-cli`. The path is likely to be `C:\Program Files\octave-5.2.0-w64\mingw64\bin\octave-cli.exe`.

    Variable name: `OCTAVE_EXECUTABLE`

    Variable value: `location:\\of\\octave\\bin\\octave-cli.exe`

5. Restart computer to make `os.environ` recognize the new path.

6. Install `matpower` that include `oct2py`.

    ```plaintext
    pip install matpower[octave]
    ```

## Extra (require `oct2py` or `matlab.engine`)

If `oct2py` or `matlab.engine` is installed, `matpower.start_instance` can be used to run `octave` or `MATLAB` with `MATPOWER` path added. Default engine is `octave`. You also can use `mypower` for added functionality as shown in [`mypower tutorial`](https://github.com/yasirroni/mypower/blob/master/tutorial.py).

```python
from matpower import start_instance

m = start_instance()
m.runpf() 
```

```python
from matpower import start_instance

m = start_instance()
mpc = m.eval('case9', verbose=False)
mpc = m.runpf(mpc)
```

```python
from matpower import path_matpower

print(path_matpower) # matpower installation location
```

Since `mpc = m.runopf()` will make `mpc` contain unsupported `<object opf_model>`, we can avoid it by request maximum number of outputs using `nout='max_nout'` in `octave`.

```python
from matpower import start_instance

m = start_instance()

mpc = m.loadcase('case9')
mpopt = m.mpoption('verbose', 2)
[baseMVA, bus, gen, gencost, branch, f, success, et] = m.runopf(mpc, mpopt, nout='max_nout')
```

Alternatively, it would be better to not parse back value that will not be use on python using `oct2py` `.eval` method. Use `;` to avoid octave print output on running the command.

```python
# import start_instance to start matpower instance
from matpower import start_instance

# start instance
m = start_instance()

# use octave native to run some commands
m.eval("mpopt = mpoption('verbose', 2);")
m.eval("mpc = loadcase('case9');")
m.eval("r1 = runopf(mpc, mpopt);") # we avoid parse `r1` that containts unsupported `<object opf_model>`

# fech data to python (.eval is used because .pull is not working in acessing field)
r1_mpc = {}
r1_mpc['baseMVA'] = m.eval('r1.baseMVA;')
r1_mpc['version'] = m.eval('r1.version;')
r1_mpc['bus'] = m.eval('r1.bus;')
r1_mpc['gen'] = m.eval('r1.gen;')
r1_mpc['branch'] = m.eval('r1.branch;')
r1_mpc['gencost'] = m.eval('r1.gencost;')

# modify variable if necessary

 RAMP_AGC, RAMP_10, RAMP_30, RAMP_Q, APF] = m.idx_gen(nout='max_nout')
gen_index = 2 # index of generator to be changed
gen_index_ = int(gen_index - 1) # -1 due to python indexing start from 0
PMAX_ = int(PMAX -1) # -1 due to python indexing start from 0
r1_mpc['gen'][gen_index_,PMAX_] = 110 # in this example, we modify PMAX to be 110

 BUS_AREA, VM, VA, BASE_KV, ZONE, VMAX, VMIN, LAM_P, 
 LAM_Q, MU_VMAX, MU_VMIN] = m.idx_bus(nout='max_nout')
bus_index = 7 # index of bus to be changed
bus_index_ = int(bus_index - 1) # -1 due to python indexing start from 0
PD_ = int(PD-1) # -1 due to python indexing start from 0
r1_mpc['bus'][bus_index_,int(PD-1)] = 80 # in this example, we modify PD to be 150

# push back value to octave client
m.push('mpc', r1_mpc) # push r1_mpc in python to mpc in octave

# test if we can retrive pushed value
mpc = m.pull('mpc')

# test if our pushed variable can be used
m.eval("r1 = runopf(mpc, mpopt);")
```

Also support using `matlab.engine`.

```python
from matpower import start_instance

m = start_instance(engine='matlab') # specify using `matlab.engine` instead of `oct2py`
mpc = m.runpf('case5', nargout=0)
```

You can explore other example on [notebooks](notebooks/).

## Known engine issue

### Octave

1. `m.runopf()` will make `mpc` contain unsupported `<object opf_model>`. See: <https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower/issues/134#issuecomment-1007798733>

    Impacted case:

    ```python
    r1 = m.runopf(mpc)
    ```

    Solution:

    ```python
    m.push('mpc', mpc)
    m.eval("r1 = runopf(mpc, mpopt);")

    r1_mpc = {}
    r1_mpc['baseMVA'] = m.eval('r1.baseMVA;')
    r1_mpc['version'] = m.eval('r1.version;')
    r1_mpc['bus'] = m.eval('r1.bus;')
    r1_mpc['gen'] = m.eval('r1.gen;')
    r1_mpc['branch'] = m.eval('r1.branch;')
    r1_mpc['gencost'] = m.eval('r1.gencost;')
    ```

## Versioning

This package maintain `MATPOWER` version with added version mark, i.e. `MATPOWER 7.1` become `7.1.0.x.x.x` where `.x.x.x` come from `matpower-pip` versioning. The `matpower-pip` versioning is not released on `pypi` since `matpower-pip` is restricted for development only (and development should use git instead).

## TODO

1. `conda` and `docker` installation that include octave-cli installation.

This repository was supported by the [Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada](https://ft.ugm.ac.id/en/) under the supervision of [Mr. Sarjiya](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarjiya_Sarjiya). If you use this package, we are very glad if you cite any relevant publication under Mr. Sarjiya's name that can be found on the [semantic scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Sarjiya/2267414) or [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37548066400) for the meantime, since publication related to this repository is ongoing. This work is also partly motivated after I found out that `oct2py` supports running `octave` client from `python`, but the only implementation for running `MATPOWER` that I know, that is [oct2pypower](https://github.com/rwl/oct2pypower), requires `docker` and is not newbie-friendly. Nevertheless, I would like to say thank you to all people who contributed to `oct2py`, `oct2pypower`, and more importantly `MATPOWER`.
